Also be warned that it edits the script it is\r\npassed **in place**. Do not point it at something that is not in source\r\ncontrol!\r\n\r\nNew solver\r\n\r\n* Switch to a greedier but more fallible algorithm for simplifying union\r\nand intersection types that are created as part of refinement\r\ncalculation. This has much better and more predictable performance.\r\n* Fix a constraint cycle in recursive function calls.\r\n* Much improved inference of binary addition. Functions like `function\r\nadd(x, y) return x + y end` can now be inferred without annotations. We\r\nalso accurately typecheck calls to functions like this.\r\n* Many small bugfixes surrounding things like table indexers\r\n* Add support for indexers on class types. This was previously added to\r\nthe old solver; we now add it to the new one for feature parity.\r\n\r\nJIT\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/Roblox/luau/pull/931\r\n* Fuse key.value and key.tt loads for CEHCK_SLOT_MATCH in A64\r\n* Implement remaining aliases of BFM for A64\r\n* Implement new callinfo flag for A64\r\n* Add instruction simplification for int->num->int conversion chains\r\n* Don't even load execdata for X64 calls\r\n* Treat opcode fallbacks the same as manually written fallbacks\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Arseny Kapoulkine <arseny.kapoulkine@gmail.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Vyacheslav Egorov <vegorov@roblox.com>",
