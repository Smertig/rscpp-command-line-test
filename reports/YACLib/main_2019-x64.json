OneShotEvent::Await was incorrect named, in reality it was AwaitSticky\r\n3. Implement real OneShotEvent::Await\r\n4. Add OneShotEvent::Call, same as Set, but doesn't prevent adding new jobs.\r\nIt's useful for scenarios like:\r\none thread do some jobs some time, for an example Writer::Commit.\r\nother thread, for an example in Transaction::Commit, want to wait and when first Writer::Commit is called.\r\n",
