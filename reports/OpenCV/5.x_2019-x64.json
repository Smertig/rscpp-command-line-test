            "commit_message": "Merge pull request #24578 from Kumataro:fix_verify_unsupported_new_mat_depth\n\nFix verify unsupported new mat depth for nonzero/minmax/lut #24578\r\n\r\n`cv::LUI()`, `cv::minMaxLoc()`, `cv::minMaxIdx()`, `cv::countNonZero()`, `cv::findNonZero()` and `cv::hasNonZero()` uses depth-based function table. However, it is too short for `CV_16BF`, `CV_Bool`, `CV_64U`, `CV_64S` and `CV_32U` and it may occur out-boundary-access. This patch fix it. And If necessary, when someone extends these functions to support, please relax this test.\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Readiness Checklist\r\n\r\nSee details at https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute#making-a-good-pull-request\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree to contribute to the project under Apache 2 License.\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, the proposed patch is not based on a code under GPL or another license that is incompatible with OpenCV\r\n- [x] The PR is proposed to the proper branch\r\n- [x] There is a reference to the original bug report and related work\r\n- [x] There is accuracy test, performance test and test data in opencv_extra repository, if applicable\r\n      Patch to opencv_extra has the same branch name.\r\n- [x] The feature is well documented and sample code can be built with the project CMake",

In ONNX importer any uint8 weight was handled as quantized weight and x = int8(x_uint8 - 128) conversion was used inside the protobuf parser. ONNX conformance tests used the same protobuf reader, so tests with uint8 inputs couldn't read the input values properly. I've made this conversion optional.\r\n\r\nThese ONNX conformance tests are enabled:\r\n- test_add_uint8\r\n- test_div_uint8\r\n- test_mul_uint8\r\n- test_sub_uint8\r\n- test_max_int8\r\n- test_max_uint8\r\n- test_min_int8\r\n- test_min_uint8\r\n- test_mod_mixed_sign_int8\r\n- test_mod_uint8\r\n\r\nThese tests were removed:\r\n- Test_two_inputs.basic (when input is uint8)\r\n- setInput.normalization (when input is uint8)\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Readiness Checklist\r\n\r\nSee details at https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute#making-a-good-pull-request\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree to contribute to the project under Apache 2 License.\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, the proposed patch is not based on a code under GPL or another license that is incompatible with OpenCV\r\n- [x] The PR is proposed to the proper branch\r\n- [ ] There is a reference to the original bug report and related work\r\n- [x] There is accuracy test, performance test and test data in opencv_extra repository, if applicable\r\n      Patch to opencv_extra has the same branch name.\r\n- [x] The feature is well documented and sample code can be built with the project CMake\r\n",
